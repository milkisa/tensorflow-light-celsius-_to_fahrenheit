# linear regression
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.the celisius values are used as input(x) and then it will predict fahrenheit 
## Tensorflow lite
It lets you run machine-learned models on mobile devices with low latency, so you can take advantage of them to do classification, regression or anything else you might want without necessarily incurring a round trip to a server.



```bash
pip install tensorflow
```


## Usage
the linear regression model is done on jupyternotebook and then added tensorflow lite to my android app in android studio.
